# Driven-Diffusive-Lattice-Gas-MC
This is some simulation code for a driven diffusive lattice gas model

This is a simulation of the KLS model. It was one of the earliest non-equilibrium systems studied in statistical physics (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.1655).  The simulation is in 2 dimensions.  We provide the simulation code, calculate the order parameter, and show the phase transition between the ordered phase and the disordered phase.

The simulation is written in Julia with the visualisation in using Python Packages
