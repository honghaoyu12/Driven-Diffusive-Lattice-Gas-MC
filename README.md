# Driven-Diffusive-Lattice-Gas-MC
This is some simulation code for a driven diffusive lattice gas model

This is a simulation of the KLS model. It was one of the earliest non-equilibrium systems studied in statistical physics (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.1655).  The simulation is in 2 dimensions.  We provide the simulation code, calculate the order parameter, and show the phase transition between the ordered phase and the disordered phase
